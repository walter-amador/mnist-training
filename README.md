# CPSC-5506EL-Intro-Computational-Science

This repository is being created for educational purposes, as a class project we want to replicate in a small scale the results from the paper: An Ensemble of Simple Convolutional Neural Network Models for MNIST Digit Recognition

## Running exercises and examples

### Requirements

- Python 3.11.x
- Libraries listed on requirements.txt files in each folder.

### Steps for MacOs

- Starting local virtual environment by running: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activating virtual environment by running: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Installing necessary requirements: `pip3 install path/to/file/requirements.txt`
- Run your python code: `python3 path/to/file/example.py`

### Steps for Windows

- Start a local virtual environment:`[python|py] -m venv venv`
- Activating virtual environment by running: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Installing necessary requirements: `pip install path/to/file/requirements.txt`
- Run your python code: `[python|py] path/to/file/example.py`

### Notes:

- Replace `path\to\file` with the actual path to your files.
- Make sure Python is added to your system's PATH environment variable for these commands to work directly in the terminal.
- Unzip data.zip file in the data folder.
